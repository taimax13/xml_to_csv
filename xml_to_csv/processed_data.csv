The initial proton at rest should be polarized along\nthe direction of the motion of the final proton. Similar results are valid for\nboth radiative $ep$ scattering and the photoproduction of pairs on a proton in\nthe Bethe--Heitler kinematics. When the initial proton is fully polarized in\nthe direction of the motion of the final proton, the cross section for the $ep\n\\to ep$ process, as well as for the $ep \\to ep \\gamma$ and $\\gamma p \\to e \\bar\ne p$ processes, without (with) proton spin flip is expressed only in terms of\nthe square of the electric (magnetic) proton form factor. Such an experiment on\nthe measurement of the cross sections without and with proton spin flip would\nmake it possible to acquire new independent data on the behavior of\n$G_E^2(Q^2)$ and $G_M^2(Q^2)$, which are necessary for resolving the\ncontradictions appearing after the experiment of the JLab collaboration on the\nmeasurement of the proton form factors with the method of polarization transfer\nfrom the initial electron to the final proton.'}","[{'name': 'M.

Proton-rich nucleosynthesis in stars tends to occur only when hydrogen-rich

neutrino interactions in the winds from a nascent proto-neutron star or

the Fe-peak nuclei with the largest binding energy per nucleon that have a
